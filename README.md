# [Shopping Cart](https://ephraim-9-shopping-cart.netlify.app)

## Description

The **Shopping Cart** is a simple yet dynamic e-commerce interface built with **React**. It allows users to browse a collection of products, add them to a cart, adjust quantities, and remove items as needed. It includes persistent cart state using localStorage to retain items between sessions. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of React state management, dynamic rendering, and localStorage usage for real-world shopping scenarios.

## Skills Demonstrated

- React.js fundamentals: `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`
- Component-based architecture and prop-driven rendering
- Dynamic UI updates with real-time user interaction
- State persistence using `localStorage`
- Handling user input, events, and conditional rendering

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- Vite (for fast development/building)
- DummyJSON API (for fetching product data)
- Netlify (for deployment)

## Installation Instructions

To run the **Shopping Cart** project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ephraim-9/shopping-cart.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd shopping-cart
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   npm run dev
   ```

5. Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Usage

- Browse through the list of products on the **Shop** page.
- Adjust the quantity using the + / - buttons or manually.
- Click "Add to Cart" to add products.
- Navigate to the **Cart** page to view, update, or remove items.
- The cart persists even after reloading the page, thanks to `localStorage`.

## Features

- **Add to Cart**: Add multiple products with adjustable quantities.
- **Quantity Control**: Change product quantities with buttons or input.
- **Remove from Cart**: Instantly remove products from the cart.
- **Persistent State**: Cart data is saved and reloaded using localStorage.
- **Responsive UI**: Designed with Tailwind for smooth responsive layouts.

## Learning Outcomes

This project provided hands-on experience in:

- Structuring React apps using reusable components and context for state sharing
- Understanding how to manage local and global state with `useState` and Context API
- Syncing application state with localStorage to persist user interactions
- Debugging real-time UI updates and refining logic for cleaner UX
- Managing fetch operations and side effects using `useEffect`
